# This manifest modifies the default workspace defined in west.yml to only
# include the minimum set of dependencies required to run
# nrf/scripts/print_toolchain_checksum.sh to get the NCS toolchain bundle ID.
# The `golioth` SDK dependency defines the `nrf` SDK version in it's own
# west-ncs.yml manifest, it needs to be included for the `nrf` dependency to be
# resolved.
